        rationale: "After comprehensive analysis using zen tools (planner, consensus, thinkdeep), chose clean ConPort schema upgrade approach over complex UUID adaptation layer. Critical insight: discovered actual ConPort schema uses UUID primary keys, TEXT[] tags, and only 4 relationship types - incompatible with original AGE design assumptions. Instead of working around these mismatches with complex transformations during AGE migration, we upgrade ConPort schema first to be AGE-compatible (INTEGER IDs, JSONB tags, 8 relationship types), then perform simple 1:1 copy to AGE. This eliminates 10-15% UUID string overhead, reduces migration complexity, improves ConPort long-term, and results in cleaner architecture for both systems.",
        implementation: "TWO-PHASE APPROACH: **Phase 1 - ConPort Upgrade (7 min):** (1) Export 94 decisions + 18 relationships to JSON backup, (2) Create decisions_v2 table with SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, JSONB tags, status/implementation fields, graph_version, hop_distance, old_uuid mapping column, (3) Create entity_relationships_v2 with INTEGER foreign keys and 8 relationship types (SUPERSEDES, DEPENDS_ON, IMPLEMENTS, EXTENDS, VALIDATES, CORRECTS, BUILDS_UPON, RELATES_TO), (4) Re-ingest with transformations: UUID\u2192INTEGER sequential by created_at, TEXT[]\u2192JSONB, confidence_level\u2192status, alternatives\u2192implementation, 4 rel types\u21928 types (implements/relates_to/blocks/caused_by mapped to new types), (5) Validate: decision count, relationship count, no orphans, UUID mapping complete, (6) Atomic switchover: rename decisions_v2\u2192decisions, restart MCP server. **Phase 2 - Simple AGE Migration (5 min):** (1) Extract from upgraded ConPort (schemas now match!), (2) Direct 1:1 copy to AGE nodes, (3) Direct 1:1 copy relationships to edges, (4) Create 12 indexes (6 vertex BTREE/GIN, 6 edge BTREE/GIN), (5) Compute hop_distance via BFS, (6) Validate <150ms p95 for 3-hop queries. **Safety:** Transaction-based migration with savepoints, JSON backup enables rollback, keep old tables until AGE validated, dry-run testing with 10-decision subset, comprehensive validation at each step.",

        rationale: "Critical discovery during execution: Actual ConPort backend is SQLite at context_portal/context.db, NOT PostgreSQL. SQLite schema inspection reveals it already has everything needed for AGE: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (no UUID!), implementation_details field present, tags as JSON strings, 112 decisions, 12 relationships with 9 relationship types (implements, builds_upon, validates, extends, establishes, enables, corrects, depends_on, fulfills). This eliminates need for entire \"Phase 1: ConPort Upgrade\" - we can migrate directly from SQLite to AGE with minimal transformations. Only conversions needed: source_item_id VARCHAR\u2192INTEGER cast, tags TEXT\u2192JSONB. Supersedes Decision #112's two-phase approach with simpler single-phase migration.",

Benefits vs two-phase: No ConPort downtime needed, no UUID mapping complexity, no schema upgrade risk, simpler codebase (5 scripts vs 10), faster execution (5 min vs 12 min), SQLite remains authoritative source. Schema advantages: INTEGER IDs native (optimal performance), implementation_details already populated, 9 relationship types exceeds our 8-type design, JSON tags directly compatible with JSONB.
