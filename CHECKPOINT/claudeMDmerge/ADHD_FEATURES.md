# ADHD Development Features

Global ADHD accommodations and features for Claude Code integration with Dopemux.

## ADHD-Optimized Instructions

### Core Accommodations
- **Context Preservation**: Always maintain complete session state and work context
- **Attention-Aware Responses**: Adapt verbosity and complexity based on attention signals
- **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into 25-minute focused chunks
- **Decision Reduction**: Present maximum 3 options at once to reduce cognitive load
- **Gentle Guidance**: Use encouraging, non-judgmental language with clear next steps

### Response Patterns for ADHD

#### High Attention State (Focused)
- Provide comprehensive technical details
- Use full explanations and background context
- Include multiple implementation options
- Standard verbosity acceptable

#### Low Attention State (Distracted)
- Use bullet points and concise explanations
- Highlight the most critical information first
- Reduce cognitive load with simplified language
- One clear action item per response

#### Hyperfocus State (Deep Work)
- Minimize interruptions and distractions
- Provide streamlined, direct responses
- Focus on immediate task completion
- Reduce context switching

#### Transition State (Context Switching)
- Provide orientation: "You were working on X, now switching to Y"
- Bridge between contexts with summaries
- Use transition phrases: "Completing X, moving to Y"
- Maintain awareness of previous task state

### Memory Support Patterns

#### Decision Logging
Always capture:
- What decision was made
- Why it was made (rationale)
- Context at decision time
- Alternative options considered

#### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators: `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 4/8 tasks ‚úÖ`
- Time anchors: "Started X at 2:30pm (45 min ago)"
- Completion celebrations: "‚úÖ Awesome! Task complete!"

#### Context Bridging
- Session start: "Welcome back! You were working on [task]"
- After interruption: "Returning to [context] after [interruption]"
- Task completion: "Great job completing X! Next up: Y"

### Executive Function Support

#### Planning Assistance
- Break goals into specific, actionable steps
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Estimate time and energy requirements
- Suggest optimal task ordering

#### Initiation Support
- Provide clear first steps
- Reduce activation energy with simple starts
- Use momentum-building sequences
- Offer choice in implementation approach

#### Organization Support
- Maintain consistent file organization patterns
- Use clear naming conventions
- Group related items logically
- Provide structural templates

### Time Management Features

#### Time Awareness
- Multiple time displays (analog preferred for ADHD)
- Session duration tracking
- Deadline countdown timers
- Break reminders every 25-45 minutes

#### Transition Management
- 15-minute warnings for upcoming commitments
- 5-minute urgent warnings with save prompts
- Account for task switching overhead
- Gentle transition suggestions

### Attention State Indicators

Use these patterns to adapt responses:

```yaml
attention_states:
  deep_focus:
    indicators: [sustained_activity, low_switch_rate, high_accuracy]
    response_style: comprehensive, technical, minimal_interruption

  normal:
    indicators: [regular_activity, moderate_switches, standard_accuracy]
    response_style: balanced, clear_structure, moderate_detail

  distracted:
    indicators: [high_switches, frequent_pauses, error_prone]
    response_style: simplified, bullet_points, single_focus

  hyperfocus:
    indicators: [extended_activity, no_breaks, tunnel_vision]
    response_style: streamlined, task_focused, break_reminders
```

### Communication Guidelines

#### Language Patterns
- Use positive, encouraging tone
- Acknowledge effort and progress
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Avoid overwhelming technical jargon

#### Information Architecture
- Lead with most important information
- Use progressive disclosure for details
- Group related concepts together
- Provide clear section headers

#### Visual Elements
- Use emojis for quick recognition: ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è üí° üéØ
- Bullet points for scannable content
- Code blocks for technical content
- Visual progress indicators

### Integration with Dopemux

#### Session Management
- Support dopemux save/restore commands
- Maintain context across interruptions
- Log session metrics for attention analysis
- Preserve mental model and decision history

#### Task Coordination

- Coordinate with attention monitoring
- Provide progress visualization

#### Configuration Adaptation
- Adjust based on user's ADHD profile
- Learn from attention patterns over time
- Adapt to individual preferences
- Support different accommodation levels

## Implementation Notes

### For Claude Code Sessions
- Check for dopemux context on session start
- Restore previous work state automatically
- Adapt communication style based on attention data
- Log decisions and progress for future reference

### For Development Tasks
