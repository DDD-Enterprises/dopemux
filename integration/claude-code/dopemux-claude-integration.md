# Dopemux-Claude Code Integration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integrating Claude Code with the enhanced Dopemux MCP server stack, replacing standard MCP servers with our ADHD-optimized, role-aware intelligence platform.

## Integration Architecture

### Phase 1: MetaMCP Bridge Integration
- **Primary Entry Point**: `metamcp_server.py` serves as the MCP-compatible interface
- **Role Management**: Automatic role detection based on Claude Code context
- **Tool Routing**: Intelligent routing through MetaMCP broker to appropriate specialized servers

### Phase 2: Enhanced Configuration
- **Config File**: Enhanced `.claude/config.json` with Dopemux-specific optimizations
- **Server Management**: Integration with `start-all-mcp-servers.sh` orchestration
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and failover mechanisms

### Phase 3: ADHD Optimization Integration
- **Session Management**: 25-minute Pomodoro-aligned sessions with gentle transitions
- **Context Preservation**: Cross-session memory through ConPort and unified memory stack
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Role-based tool mounting to reduce cognitive load

## Mapping Standard → Enhanced

### Code Navigation & Search
**Standard**: `filesystem` + basic search
**Enhanced**: `serena` + `claude-context` + `conport-memory`
- Semantic code understanding
- Cross-project context preservation
- Intelligent file relationship mapping

### Project Management
**Standard**: `github` basic operations
**Enhanced**: `task-master-ai` + `conport` + `leantime-mcp`
- ADHD-optimized task breakdown
- Cross-tool project state synchronization
- Intelligent dependency tracking

### Research & Information
**Standard**: `brave-search` / `perplexity`
**Enhanced**: `exa` + `context7` + `docrag`
- Higher quality, developer-focused search results
- Official documentation prioritization
- RAG-enhanced code documentation

### Reasoning & Analysis
**Standard**: `sequential-thinking` (basic)
**Enhanced**: `mas-sequential-thinking` + `zen`
- Multi-model consensus for complex decisions
- Role-aware reasoning patterns
- ADHD-accommodated thinking processes

### Memory & Context
**Standard**: Session-only context
**Enhanced**: `conport-memory` + unified memory stack
- Cross-session context preservation
- Intelligent context retrieval
- Project-wide knowledge graphs

## Implementation Benefits

### For ADHD Developers
1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Role-based tool mounting prevents tool overwhelm
2. **Context Continuity**: Never lose track of what you were working on
3. **Gentle Guidance**: Accommodating notifications and break reminders
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed at appropriate cognitive capacity

### For Development Teams
1. **Intelligent Orchestration**: Right tools for the right tasks automatically
2. **Quality Assurance**: Multi-model consensus for critical decisions
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Team knowledge captured and accessible
4. **Workflow Optimization**: ADHD-tested patterns benefit all developers

### For Complex Projects
1. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Code, docs, project management unified
2. **Cross-Session Intelligence**: Project understanding builds over time
3. **Dependency Awareness**: Intelligent relationship mapping
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Role-based access scales with team growth

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Parallel Deployment
- Run standard and enhanced MCP servers simultaneously
- A/B test workflows to validate improvements
- Gradual transition based on user preference

### Step 2: Enhanced Features Activation
- Enable ADHD optimizations progressively
- Introduce role-based mounting with fallbacks
- Activate advanced memory features

### Step 3: Full Integration
- Replace standard MCP servers entirely
- Enable full MetaMCP orchestration
- Activate all ADHD accommodations

## Technical Architecture

### MetaMCP Server as Primary Interface
```
Claude Code ← JSON-RPC → MetaMCP Server ← Broker → Specialized Servers
                                       ↓
                              Role Manager + Policy Engine
                                       ↓
                              ADHD Optimization Layer
```

### Enhanced Tool Mounting
- **Developer Role**: serena, claude-context, morphllm-fast-apply
- **Researcher Role**: exa, context7, docrag
- **Planner Role**: task-master-ai, conport, leantime-mcp
- **Architect Role**: zen, sequential-thinking, claude-context

### Session Management
- **ConPort Integration**: 25-minute session chunks with state preservation
- **Memory Stack**: Unified memory across all tools and sessions
- **Context Bridges**: Intelligent context transfer between roles

## Quality Assurance

### Health Monitoring
- **Server Health**: Automated health checks for all MCP servers
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, success rate, token usage tracking
- **ADHD Metrics**: Attention span, context switch frequency, break adherence

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to standard MCP servers if enhanced servers fail
- **Safe Mode**: Minimal toolset for emergency operations
- **Manual Override**: Break-glass access for critical situations

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- **Context Preservation**: 95%+ session continuity across interruptions
- **Task Completion**: 40%+ improvement in complex task completion rates
- **Cognitive Load**: 50%+ reduction in tool selection decisions

### Technical Performance
- **Response Time**: Sub-1s tool mounting and execution
- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ uptime for critical path servers
- **Memory Efficiency**: 60%+ reduction in repeated context loading

### ADHD Accommodations
- **Break Adherence**: 80%+ adherence to Pomodoro patterns
- **Attention Management**: 70%+ reduction in attention fragmentation
- **Context Switches**: 50%+ improvement in context switch handling
