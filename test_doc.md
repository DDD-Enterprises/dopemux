# Project Architecture Discussion

## Features
Users can create and manage projects through a web interface. The system supports real-time collaboration between team members.

## Components
The application consists of a React frontend, Node.js API server, and PostgreSQL database. Each component handles specific responsibilities.

## Decisions
We decided to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for better type safety. The team chose React over Vue because of existing team expertise.

## Requirements
The system must support 1000 concurrent users and provide sub-second response times. Data backup is required every 24 hours.

## Constraints
The application cannot exceed $500/month in hosting costs. All data must remain within EU boundaries for GDPR compliance.
