# MCP Server Detailed Analysis Plan

## üéØ **Objective**: Complete Tool-by-Tool Analysis for Optimal MetaMCP Configuration

---

## üìã **Comprehensive Analysis Checklist**

### **For Each MCP Server We Need:**

#### **1. Tool Discovery**
- [ ] Connect to server and list all available tools
- [ ] Get tool schemas/definitions
- [ ] Identify tool versions and compatibility
- [ ] Document any tool aliases or variants

#### **2. Tool Documentation**
For EVERY single tool:
- [ ] **Name**: Exact tool name as called
- [ ] **Description**: What it does
- [ ] **Input Schema**: Complete parameter list with types
- [ ] **Output Schema**: Return format and types
- [ ] **Error Conditions**: What can go wrong
- [ ] **Examples**: Real usage examples

#### **3. Performance Analysis**
- [ ] **Latency**: Response time for each tool
- [ ] **Token Usage**: Input/output token counts
- [ ] **Rate Limits**: Any throttling or limits
- [ ] **Concurrency**: Can tools run in parallel?
- [ ] **Caching**: What gets cached and for how long

#### **4. Integration Analysis**
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Other tools needed
- [ ] **Conflicts**: Tools that shouldn't run together
- [ ] **Sequences**: Common tool chains
- [ ] **Data Flow**: How data passes between tools

## üîç **Detailed Server Analysis Tasks**

### **ZEN SERVER (Multi-Model Consensus)**
**Research needed:**
- Get complete list of workflow tools (consensus, codereview, etc.)
- Understand model selection mechanism
- Document consensus voting process
- Map tool-to-model routing
- Measure token multiplication (multiple models = multiple costs)

**Key questions:**
- How many models participate in consensus?
- Can we control which models are used?
- What's the token cost multiplication factor?
- How does it handle model disagreements?

### **CLAUDE-CONTEXT (Semantic Search)**
**Research needed:**
- All search methods and parameters
- Indexing strategies and costs
- Embedding generation process
- Vector database queries
- Context window optimization

**Key questions:**
- How often does it re-index?
- What's the embedding token cost?
- How many results can it return?
- Can it search specific file types?

### **SERENA (Code Navigation)**
**Research needed:**
- Complete LSP method list
- Symbol navigation capabilities
- File system operations
- Execution permissions
- Memory management

**Key questions:**
- What languages are fully supported?
- How does it handle large files?
- What are the execution limits?
- Can it modify multiple files atomically?

### **MORPHLLM-FAST-APPLY (Code Transformation)**
**Research needed:**
- Transformation patterns available
- Bulk operation capabilities
- Speed vs accuracy tradeoffs
- Rollback mechanisms

**Key questions:**
- What's the actual token/second rate?
- How does it handle merge conflicts?
- Can transformations be previewed?
- What's the error rate?

### **EXA (Web Research)**
**Research needed:**
- Complete search tool inventory
- API rate limits
- Result filtering options
- Cost per search type

**Key questions:**
- Which searches cost more?
- How current is the index?
- Can we cache search results?
- What are the quotas?

### **TASK-MASTER-AI (Project Management)**
**Research needed:**
- Task schema and fields
- Dependency management
- Integration with external PMs
- Notification systems

**Key questions:**
- How does it track progress?
- Can it integrate with Jira/GitHub?
- What are the task limits?
- How does it handle conflicts?

### **CONPORT-MEMORY (Session Persistence)**
**Research needed:**
- Storage mechanisms
- Memory capacity limits
- Retrieval methods
- Cross-session capabilities

**Key questions:**
- How much can it store?
- How long does memory persist?
- Can it share between sessions?
- What's the retrieval speed?

### **MAS-SEQUENTIAL-THINKING (Deep Reasoning)**
**Research needed:**
- Reasoning depth controls
- Token consumption patterns
- Thinking strategies
- Output formats

**Key questions:**
- How deep can reasoning go?
- What triggers depth limits?
- Can we control verbosity?
- How does it handle timeouts?

## üî¨ **Testing Protocol**

### **Phase 1: Tool Discovery** (2-3 hours)
1. Connect to each server
2. Call list_tools or equivalent
3. Document all available methods
4. Save tool schemas

### **Phase 2: Individual Tool Testing** (4-6 hours)
1. Test each tool with minimal input
2. Test with complex input
3. Test error conditions
4. Measure performance

### **Phase 3: Integration Testing** (2-3 hours)
1. Test tool combinations
2. Test role transitions
3. Test escalation scenarios
4. Test failure modes

### **Phase 4: Cost Analysis** (1-2 hours)
1. Measure token usage per tool
2. Calculate role budgets
3. Identify expensive operations
4. Optimize tool selection
