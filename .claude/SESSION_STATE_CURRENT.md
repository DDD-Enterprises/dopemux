# Dopemux Session State - Current Session

**Session Date**: September 19, 2025, 18:15
**Context Status**: Ready for Implementation Phase
**Phase**: MCP Orchestration - Post-Analysis, Pre-Implementation

## 🎯 Current Session Summary

### ✅ Major Accomplishments This Session

1. **Health Issues Resolved**
   - Fixed missing config files (created .dopemux/config.json, .claude/config.json)
   - Initialized ADHD features (attention.json, context.json)
   - Verified MAS Sequential Thinking server functionality
   - System health improved from 4 warnings to 2 minor warnings

2. **Session Context Successfully Restored**
   - Loaded previous MCP orchestration work from SESSION_STATE_MCP_ORCHESTRATOR.md
   - Reviewed comprehensive tool inventory analysis (100+ tools across 12+ servers)
   - Validated existing workflow mapping and role-based architecture
   - Confirmed token optimization strategy (<10k per role)

3. **Architecture Status Confirmed**
   - Tool inventory: COMPLETE (100+ tools mapped)
   - Role definitions: COMPLETE (11 specialized roles)
   - Workflow patterns: COMPLETE (automatic triggering system)
   - Memory synchronization: COMPLETE (4-layer architecture)
   - Token optimization: COMPLETE (<10k budget per role)

### 📋 Current System Status

#### Health Check Results (Much Improved)
- ✅ Dopemux Core: Healthy
- ✅ Claude Code: Healthy (4 processes)
- ⚠️ MCP Servers: Minor issues (functional)
- ⚠️ Docker Services: Minor warnings (non-blocking)
- ✅ System Resources: Healthy
- ✅ ADHD Features: All active

#### MCP Servers Status
- ✅ MAS Sequential Thinking: Functional (needs API key for full operation)
- ✅ Task-Master AI: Configured in Claude config
- ✅ Leantime MCP: JavaScript server ready
- ✅ Claude-Context: Available (project needs indexing)
- ✅ Context7: Working
- ✅ Morphllm: Working
- ✅ Exa: Working
- ❌ ConPort: Critical missing piece (Priority #1 installation)

#### Current Token Usage
- Active: 7,439 tokens (3.7% of 200k context)
- Target with ConPort: ~10,439 tokens (5.2% - within target)

## 🚀 Next Steps After Claude Code Restart

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1: Core Infrastructure)

1. **Install ConPort** (Priority #1)
   - Repository: github.com/GreatScottyMac/context-portal
   - Impact: 30+ memory management tools
   - Benefit: Context preservation, knowledge graph, session restoration

2. **Test MAS Sequential Thinking** with API keys
   - Set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in environment
   - Validate complex reasoning functionality
   - Test multi-agent coordination

3. **Implement Role Manager**
   - Start with basic role switching logic
   - Implement dynamic tool loading/unloading
   - Create context-based role detection

### Files to Continue With

1. **Architecture Documents**:
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/baseDataAndDesign.md` - Main architecture
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/COMPLETE_TOOL_WORKFLOW_MAPPING.md` - Tool mappings
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/ACTUAL_MCP_TOOLS_INVENTORY.md` - Tool inventory

2. **Implementation Areas**:
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/src/dopemux/cli.py` - Enhanced CLI
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/src/dopemux/health.py` - Health monitoring
   - `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/.claude/task-master-mcp-config.json` - MCP configuration

### Key Context to Preserve

**Current Goal**: Implement Phase 1 of MCP orchestration system
- Memory Router: Unified memory synchronization
- Role Manager: Dynamic tool orchestration
- Trigger System: Context-based automation

**Architecture Vision**:
"Magical implicit coordination where tools load exactly when needed, context is always perfect, and the user experiences seamless development with zero manual overhead."

**Success Metrics**:
- Token usage: <10k active (90% reduction target)
- Context switches: <5 seconds
- Workflow completion: 80% automated
- ADHD satisfaction: 95% positive

## 🧠 ADHD Context Preservation

### Session Continuity
- **Mental Model**: MCP orchestration system with role-based tool loading
- **Current Focus**: Implementation phase after comprehensive analysis
- **Energy Level**: High (successful session restoration and health fixes)
- **Next Activation**: ConPort installation → Role Manager → Testing

### Decision History
- Health issues resolved as prerequisite
- MAS Sequential Thinking validated as functional
- Tool inventory analysis confirmed complete
- Ready for implementation phase

### Working Memory
- 11 specialized roles defined with token budgets
- 100+ tools mapped across 12+ MCP servers
- 4-layer memory synchronization architecture designed
- Automatic triggering system specified

---

**Status**: Ready for Claude Code restart with full context preservation
**Next Session Goal**: Install ConPort and begin implementation
**Estimated Time**: 25-45 minutes for ConPort setup and initial testing
