# Dopemux MCP Orchestration - Session State & Next Steps

**Session Date**: December 19, 2024
**Context Status**: Ready for MAS Sequential Thinking
**Phase**: Architecture Enhancement & Tool Integration

## üéØ Current Session Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

1. **Deep Analysis of Claude-flow vs Custom Systems**
   - Analyzed 400+ lines of architectural research
   - Identified hybrid approach combining best of both systems
   - Documented hook patterns, memory integration, and orchestration strategies

2. **Enhanced baseDataAndDesign.md**
   - Added comprehensive hook system architecture
   - Documented three-tier memory synchronization (Claude-flow SQLite, ConPort, OpenMemory)
   - Created complete role definitions with ALL MCP servers
   - Designed workflow automation patterns
   - Integrated ADHD support throughout

3. **Key Architectural Decisions**
   - Hybrid hook system combining Claude-flow and custom hooks
   - Unified memory router for seamless context management
   - Role-based tool orchestration keeping tokens under 10k
   - Automatic workflow detection and adaptation
   - Proactive knowledge graph linking

### üìã Current Task List

1. Research and catalog ALL tools from every MCP server
2. Map tools to role-based workflows and triggers
3. Design hook and implicit trigger systems
4. Architect multi-level memory integration
5. Create workflow automation patterns
6. Design context assembly and management system
7. Document ADHD-optimized user journeys
8. Create comprehensive MetaMCP Orchestrator document

## üöÄ Next Steps After Restart

### Immediate Priority (Use MAS Sequential Thinking)

1. **Complete Tool Inventory**
   - Use MAS to analyze each MCP server's complete tool list
   - Map tools to specific workflows
   - Calculate token costs per tool
   - Create tool dependency graph

2. **Design Workflow Patterns**
   - Common development workflows (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
   - Content creation workflows
   - Life management workflows
   - Cross-domain workflows

3. **Memory Synchronization Protocol**
   - How to sync between Claude-flow SQLite, ConPort, OpenMemory
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Memory retention policies
   - Automatic cleanup and archival

### Files to Read After Restart

1. `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/baseDataAndDesign.md` - Main architecture (now enhanced)
2. `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/SESSION_STATE.md` - This file
3. `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/docs/mcpOrchestratorTemp/Architecture and Orchestration Research Claude Flow vs Vlaude code.md` - Research source

## üß† Key Context for MAS Sequential Thinking

### Primary Question for MAS
"Design a complete tool orchestration system that maps every tool from 12+ MCP servers into role-based workflows with automatic triggering through hooks and context detection. The system should provide magical implicit coordination where tools load exactly when needed, context is always perfect, and the user experiences seamless development with zero manual overhead."

### Specific Areas to Explore with MAS

1. **Tool Mapping Strategy**
   - How to categorize 100+ tools across 12 servers
   - Optimal groupings for role-based loading
   - Tool dependency and conflict management

2. **Workflow Detection Patterns**
   - How to detect user's current workflow phase
   - Transition triggers between roles
   - Implicit vs explicit role switching

3. **Memory Architecture**
   - Synchronization protocols
   - Conflict resolution
   - Performance optimization

4. **ADHD Support Integration**
   - Attention state detection
   - Intervention strategies
   - Celebration and reward systems

## üìÅ Architecture Components Defined

### Roles (11 Total)
1. researcher - Information gathering with MAS, Exa, Context7
2. implementer - Code generation with Morphllm, Claude-Context
3. reviewer - Quality assurance with Zen consensus
4. architect - System design with MAS sequential thinking
5. task_manager - Task breakdown with Task-Master AI
6. debugger - Problem solving with Zen debug
7. documenter - Documentation with Morphllm
8. product_manager - Planning with Leantime
9. scrum_master - Process management
10. session_orchestrator - Automatic context management
11. knowledge_curator - Memory and learning capture

### Memory Stores (4 Layers)
1. Claude-flow SQLite - Fast working memory
2. ConPort - Project-specific persistent memory
3. OpenMemory - Cross-session memory
4. Letta - Long-term intelligent memory

### Hook Types
1. Session lifecycle (start, end, checkpoint)
2. Operation hooks (pre/post edit, command, task)
3. ADHD checkpoints (25-minute intervals)
4. Workflow transitions (role changes)
5. Memory synchronization (auto-save, restore)

## üîß Required MCP Servers

### Core Servers (Must Have)
1. ConPort - Memory hub
2. Zen MCP - Multi-model orchestration
3. Task-Master AI - Task management
4. MAS Sequential Thinking - Complex reasoning
5. Claude-Context - Code search
6. Morphllm-Fast-Apply - Code editing

### Enhancement Servers (Important)
7. Leantime - Project management
8. Context7 - Documentation
