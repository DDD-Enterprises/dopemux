# ConPort Context Persistence - Session 2025-09-28

## Key Decisions for ConPort Learning System

### Strategic Architecture Decision
**Decision**: Build custom task decomposition engine using distributed MCP intelligence
**Context**: Research showed external TaskMaster-AI has dependency issues, our infrastructure is superior
**Impact**: Avoids external dependencies, leverages multi-model intelligence, enables ADHD optimization
**Tags**: strategic-architecture, task-decomposition, mcp-ecosystem

### Technical Implementation Decision
**Decision**: Integration Bridge as central task orchestration engine
**Context**: Complete 1,578-line implementation provides task lifecycle, LeanTime sync, ADHD workflows
**Impact**: Cross-plane coordination, multi-instance support, template system ready
**Tags**: integration-bridge, task-orchestration, implementation

### ADHD Workflow Decision
**Decision**: Progressive disclosure with authority boundaries for neurodivergent development
**Context**: Core services first, clear separation between PM and Cognitive planes
**Impact**: Reduces cognitive load, maintains mental models, enables context preservation
**Tags**: adhd-optimization, progressive-disclosure, authority-boundaries

## Progress Tracking

### Completion Status
- ✅ Infrastructure: Unified architecture operational
- ✅ Coordination: Integration Bridge providing cross-plane communication
- ✅ Intelligence: Multi-model MCP ecosystem ready
- ⚠️  Integration: LeanTime bridge needs port fix and API configuration
- 🚀 Pipeline: Document intelligence ready for implementation

### Learning Patterns
- **Successful**: Progressive service enablement reduces complexity
- **Successful**: Health monitoring prevents silent failures
- **Successful**: ADHD-optimized templates improve task completion
- **Blocked**: External dependencies create maintenance burden
- **Insight**: Internal distributed intelligence > external monolithic solutions

## Context Preservation for Next Session

### Current Mental Model
- Unified architecture is our stable foundation
- Integration Bridge is the orchestration powerhouse
- Multi-model intelligence via Zen exceeds research report solutions
- LeanTime integration is nearly complete (port fix needed)
- Custom implementation path chosen over external dependencies

### Attention Focus Areas
- Fix LeanTime networking (immediate blocker)
- Enable bridge service (unlock integration)
- Document pipeline (high-value development)
- Learning system (long-term optimization)

### Energy and Momentum State
- High: Unified architecture successfully deployed
- High: Strategic vision clarified and superior to research report
- Medium: Minor blockers but clear path forward
- High: Strong foundation for next development phase
