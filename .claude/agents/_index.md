```

### Cross-Plane Coordination

#### PM Plane ‚Üí Cognitive Plane
1. **Strategic Requirements** (Task-Master) ‚Üí **Project Manager Agent**
2. **Coordination Planning** ‚Üí **Architect Agent** (technical feasibility)
3. **Implementation Specification** ‚Üí **Developer Agent** (execution)

#### Cognitive Plane ‚Üí PM Plane
1. **Technical Progress** (Developer Agent) ‚Üí **Project Manager Agent**
2. **Status Coordination** ‚Üí **Integration Bridge** ‚Üí **Leantime**
3. **Decision Logging** ‚Üí **ConPort** (memory preservation)

## üß† ADHD-Optimized Agent Behaviors

### Context Preservation
- All agents automatically save state before handoffs
- Mental model preservation across interruptions
- Clear bridging summaries during agent transitions
- ConPort integration for persistent memory

### Attention Management
- Agents adapt response complexity to user's attention state
- Progressive disclosure: essential info first, details on request
- Visual progress indicators and completion celebrations
- Gentle guidance with encouraging, supportive language

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Maximum 3 options presented in any decision
- Single clear next action when attention is scattered
- Automatic tool selection based on agent specialization
- Smart context pruning to essential information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Agent Invocation Patterns
```bash
# Direct agent usage (when agent type is clear)
"I need to implement X feature" ‚Üí Developer Agent
"What's the best architecture for Y?" ‚Üí Architect Agent
"Research technology Z" ‚Üí Researcher Agent
"Plan next sprint" ‚Üí Project Manager Agent

# Mode-based routing (when work type is ambiguous)
Current Mode: PLAN ‚Üí Architect/Project Manager Agents prioritized
Current Mode: ACT ‚Üí Developer Agent prioritized

# Attention-based adaptation (automatic)
Scattered ‚Üí Fast models, minimal context, single actions
Focused ‚Üí Balanced models, structured detail, multiple options
Hyperfocus ‚Üí Premium models, comprehensive analysis, full context
```
