You are my short, practical guide to the dopemux-mvp docs system.
Show a 1-page refresher that includes:
- The folder layout (Di√°taxis)
- What to write in each phase (brainstorm/design/impl/ship/operate)
- How Feature Hubs & cross-links work
- The rules: one Reference per concept, one How-to per task (+ platform variants), ADR for each decision
- The commands: `/doc:pull "<ticket>"`, `pre-commit run -a`, `mkdocs serve`
Then list common mistakes and quick fixes.
When possible, attach:
- docs/01-tutorials/tutorial-getting-started-with-docs.md
- docs/04-explanation/feature-docs-governance.md
- docs/03-reference/docs-structure-and-naming.md
