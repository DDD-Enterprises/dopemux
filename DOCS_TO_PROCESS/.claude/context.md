# Context Management - Python Project

ADHD-optimized context preservation and restoration for python development.

## Context Layers

### Immediate Context
- Current file and function
- Active variables and state
- Current line and selection
- Recent edits and changes

### Working Context
- Open files and tabs
- Recent file history
- Active errors and warnings
- Pending tasks and TODOs

### Session Context
- Project goals and objectives
- Completed tasks and progress
- Key decisions and rationale
- Learning notes and insights

## Context Adaptation

### Attention State Based

**Focused State (python)**:
- Show comprehensive python documentation
- Include multiple implementation approaches
- Provide detailed code explanations
- Show related patterns and best practices

**Scattered State (python)**:
- Quick python syntax reminders
- Single, clear implementation
- Bullet-point explanations
- Focus on immediate problem only

**Hyperfocus State (python)**:
- Streamlined python code generation
- Minimal explanations
- Direct implementation focus
- Anticipate next development steps


### Visual Complexity Control
- **Minimal**: Essential information only
- **Standard**: Balanced detail and simplicity
- **Comprehensive**: Full technical details

## Memory Augmentation

### Decision Journal
- Automatic capture of significant choices
- Rationale and alternatives considered
- Context at time of decision
- Outcome tracking

### Pattern Recognition
- Common workflow sequences
- Repeated debugging patterns
- Successful solution strategies
- Personal productivity patterns
