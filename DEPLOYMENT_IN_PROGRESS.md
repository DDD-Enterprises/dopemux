## üîÑ Active Builds

**1. Task-Orchestrator + Leantime-Bridge**
- Command: `docker-compose up -d task-orchestrator leantime-bridge`
- Status: Building (background process)
- Expected completion: 2-5 minutes

**2. Integration Bridge**
- Command: `docker-compose up -d --build integration-bridge`
- Status: Rebuilding with MCP SDK fix
- Expected completion: 2-3 minutes

**3. gptr-mcp (Optional)**
- Command: `docker-compose up -d mcp-gptr-mcp`
- Status: Building (background process)
- Expected completion: 3-5 minutes

## ‚úÖ Already Operational

**MCP Servers:** 7/7 healthy
- conport, context7, zen, serena, mas-sequential-thinking, exa, desktop-commander

**Cognitive Plane:** 100% operational
- Serena v2 validated (75 tests passing)
- ConPort working
- Direct integration functional

**Infrastructure:** All healthy
- 3 databases (PostgreSQL x2, MySQL)
- 2 Redis caches
- Milvus vector DB
- MetaMCP orchestrator

**Leantime:** PM UI running (port 8080)

## ‚è≥ What to Expect

**When builds complete (5-10 minutes):**
1. Task-Orchestrator available (port 3014)
2. Leantime-Bridge available (port 3015)
3. Integration Bridge operational (port 3016)
4. Complete Two-Plane Architecture functional

**Then you can:**
- Sync Leantime tasks with ConPort
- Use Task-Orchestrator's 37 dependency tools
- Have Integration Bridge route cross-plane events
- Full PLAN/ACT mode coordination
