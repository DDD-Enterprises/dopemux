## 🧪 **Detailed Test Validation**

### Test 1: Database Connection
```sql

-- Validation query: SELECT 1
-- Result: ✅ Connection established, query successful
```

### Test 2: Milvus Vector Database
```python
# Collections verified: ['decisions', 'messages', 'files', 'tasks', 'agents', 'threads', 'runs']
# Connection: http://localhost:19530
# Status: ✅ All collections accessible and operational
```

### Test 3: ConPort Memory Server
```bash
# Health endpoint: http://localhost:3010/health
# Response: {"status": "healthy", "service": "ConPort Memory Server"}
# Status: ✅ HTTP server responding correctly
```

### Test 4: Memory Upsert Operations
```sql
-- Test data inserted:
INSERT INTO nodes (id, type, text, metadata, repo, author, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('test_decision_001', 'decision', 'Test decision for memory system validation',
        '{"test": true, "priority": "high"}', 'dopemux-mvp', 'test_suite',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

-- Result: ✅ Node created successfully with proper metadata
```

### Test 5: Graph Operations
```sql
-- Test nodes created: test_file_001 (file), test_task_001 (task)
-- Test relationship: test_decision_001 -> affects -> test_file_001
-- Neighbor query validation: ✅ Relationships properly traversable
```

### Test 6: Conversation Storage
```sql
-- Thread created: test_thread_001 with participants ['user', 'assistant']
-- Message stored: test_msg_001 with content and metadata
-- Result: ✅ Full conversation history preserved
```

### Test 7: Import Tracking
```sql
-- Import run logged with UUID, source, status, and metrics
-- Status tracking: ✅ Import operations properly monitored
```

### Test 8: Vector Collections
```python
# Milvus collections enumerated and validated
# Expected collections present: ✅ All 7 collections operational
```
