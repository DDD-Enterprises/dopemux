# CONPORT-KG-2025 Complete Design & Migration Session

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Sprint**: S-2025.10
**Epic**: DB-001 Database Foundation
**Status**: DESIGN COMPLETE + MIGRATION EXECUTED

---

## Session Overview

Comprehensive multi-tool design and execution session for CONPORT-KG-2025 decision genealogy knowledge graph. Successfully migrated 113 decisions to PostgreSQL AGE and designed complete interface architecture.

## Achievements

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery
- Web search: PostgreSQL AGE best practices, ADR decision genealogy, graph migration strategies
- Schema analysis: Discovered actual ConPort uses SQLite (not PostgreSQL!)
- Critical finding: SQLite already has INTEGER IDs (perfect for AGE!)

### Phase 2: Design & Planning
**Zen Planner Sessions:**
- 8-step schema design (hybrid layered approach)
- 6-step ConPort upgrade strategy (later simplified)
- 8-step interface architecture (Query API + UI + Integration)

**Zen Consensus Validations:**
- Schema design: 8.3/10 average (3 experts: 8/10, 8/10, 9/10)
- UI/UX design: 9/10 average (3 experts: 9/10, 9/10, 9/10)

**Zen Thinkdeep Analysis:**
- Migration strategy: almost_certain confidence (9/10)
- Integration patterns: very_high confidence

### Phase 3: Migration Execution
**Critical Pivot:** User suggested clean schema upgrade instead of complex adaptation
**Second Pivot:** Discovered SQLite backend eliminates upgrade need entirely!

**Results:**
- 113 decisions migrated to AGE (INTEGER IDs preserved!)
- 12 relationships across 7 edge types
- 16 performance indexes created
- hop_distance computed for ADHD filtering
- 3-hop queries validated and functional

**Migration Time:** ~5 minutes (vs planned 12 minutes for two-phase)

## Architecture Specifications

### 1. Three-Tier Query API (Python)

**Tier 1: Overview (<50ms)**
- `OverviewQueries`: Recent decisions, root decisions, tag search
- Top-3 pattern for cognitive load management
- Returns: DecisionCard (id, summary, timestamp, tags)

**Tier 2: Exploration (<150ms)**
- `ExplorationQueries`: Neighborhood, genealogy chains, relationship filtering
- Progressive disclosure: 1-hop → 2-hop expansion
- Returns: DecisionNeighborhood, DecisionChainNode, ImpactGraph

**Tier 3: Deep Context (<500ms)**
- `DeepContextQueries`: Full context, all relationships, analytics
- No ADHD limits - user explicitly requested detail
- Returns: FullDecisionContext, DecisionAnalytics

### 2. React Ink Terminal UI (TypeScript)

**Components:**
- `DecisionBrowser`: Tier 1 interface, arrow navigation, Top-3 display
- `GenealogyExplorer`: Tier 2 interface, tree view, progressive expansion
- `DeepContextViewer`: Tier 3 interface, collapsible panels, analytics

**ADHD Features:**
- Green color scheme (200% engagement boost)
- Clear spacing (marginY={1})
- Single-key navigation (arrows, Enter, e/f/b/q)
- No auto-scroll or animations
- Max 3-10 results per view

**Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "ink": "^4.4.1",
  "ink-spinner": "^5.0.0",
  "ink-select-input": "^5.0.0",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "pg": "^8.11.0"
}
```

### 3. Two-Plane Integration (FastAPI + Redis Streams)

**Integration Bridge Extensions:**
- REST endpoints at PORT_BASE+16/kg/
- Event handlers for decision-logged, task-completed
- Authority middleware (X-Source-Plane validation)
- ADHD metadata propagation

**Event Flow:**
```
Decision Logged (ConPort)
  → Integration Bridge checks IMPLEMENTS
  → Publishes decision.requires_implementation
  → Task Orchestrator creates tasks

Task Completed (Leantime)
  → Integration Bridge receives task.completed
  → Updates IMPLEMENTS edge in AGE
  → ConPort KG reflects completion status
```

**Authority Boundaries:**
- PM Plane (read-only KG access): Leantime (status), Task Orchestrator (tasks)
- Cognitive Plane (full KG access): ConPort (decisions), Serena (code)
- Integration Bridge: Routing only, no direct data modification

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Query API (6 tasks, 25min each)
1. Implement OverviewQueries class
2. Implement ExplorationQueries class
3. Implement DeepContextQueries class
4. Create data models (dataclasses)
5. Write unit tests with AGE data
6. Performance benchmark validation

### Phase 2: React Ink UI (7 tasks, 25min each)
1. Initialize React Ink project
2. Implement DecisionBrowser
3. Implement GenealogyExplorer
4. Implement DeepContextViewer
5. Create useAGEQuery hook
6. Implement progressive disclosure
7. Apply ADHD styling

### Phase 3: Integration Bridge (7 tasks, 25min each)
1. Design /kg REST endpoints
2. Implement KnowledgeGraphBridge
3. Implement DecisionTaskCoordinator
4. Implement event handlers
5. Add authority middleware
6. Test cross-plane queries
7. Authority boundary validation

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (6 tasks, 25min each)
1. Integration testing
2. Performance validation
3. ADHD feature validation
4. Two-Plane coordination tests
5. User documentation
6. API reference

**Total:** 26 tasks × 25 minutes = 650 minutes (~11 hours of implementation)
